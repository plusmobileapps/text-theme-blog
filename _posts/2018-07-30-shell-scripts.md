## Why Shell Script? 

If you find yourself running a bunch of bash commands that you would like to version control and share with others, shell script is what you are looking for.

## What is a Shell Script?

Shell scripts are an executable file that contain bash commands to *execute*. The file extension of shell scripts are `.sh` and are ran by putting a `./` in front of the file name. Putting this all together in an example: 


## Creating a Shell Script Example 

Create a file and open it in your favorite editor. 

```bash
touch dosomething.sh
code dosomething.sh
```

Add some bash commands to the file. 

```bash
# dosomething.sh
echo Hello World!
echo "Second line in bash command" 
```

Now before you can run the bash file, touching files does not give executable permissions by default. So we need to make it executable by changing the permissions with the `chmod` command. 

```bash 
chmod +x dosomething.sh
```

Finally you can run the shell script!

```bash
./dosomething.sh
```
