Below you will find a cheat sheat of all the different types of markdown text available for most markdown flavors, as well as some extensions utilized in this site.

## Headers/Titling
To do headers and subtitles, use a `#`. One `#` is the largest, and adding another `#` continues to make the text smaller.

## Coding 

```
`SomeClass` - uses back ticks around classes and functions to indicate this is the exact name in code. 

    ```kotlin 
    // Code comments
    val foo = "bar"
    println(foo)
    ```
```

Below are some sample styles for markdown code highlighting to be placed after the first three backticks. 

* kotlin
* json
* bash
* java 
* javascript

```kotlin

```

## Hyperlinking

If you want to create blue text that hyperlinks to a website like [Google](https://www.google.com), Surround the text to be shown in blue around brackets, and parantheses around the actual website link just like: `[Google](www.google.com)`

## Images 

Images supported in markdown are png, jpg, and gif's. 

```
