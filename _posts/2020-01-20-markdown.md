Markdown is a shorthand syntax for writing **highly** *stylized* text. It can be a great tool when you are taking notes, documenting code, or even writing a site like this one. 

Below you will find a cheat sheat of all the different types of markdown text available for most markdown flavors, as well as some extensions utilized in this site. 

## Headers/Titling
To do headers and subtitles, use a `#`. One `#` is the largest, and adding another `#` continues to make the text smaller. 
```
## H2 Header 

### H3 Header 

#### H4 Header 

```

```
*Italicized text has its text surrounded by single stars*

**Bold text has its text surrounded by double stars**
```

## Coding 

```
`SomeClass` - uses back ticks around classes and functions to indicate this is the exact name in code. 

    ```kotlin 
    // Code comments
    val foo = "bar"
    println(foo)
    ```
```

Below are some sample styles for markdown code highlighting to be placed after the first three backticks. 

* kotlin
* json
* bash
* java 
* javascript

```kotlin

val foo = "bar"

```

## Hyperlinking

If you want to create blue text that hyperlinks to a website like [Google](https://www.google.com), Surround the text to be shown in blue around brackets, and parantheses around the actual website link just like: `[Google](www.google.com)`

## Images 

Images supported in markdown are png, jpg, and gif's. 

```
![Sample Screenshot description](/assets/images/sample.gif)
```

`![The description that displays to the user when hovered over](relative path to image)`

|---|---|---|
| Fizz  | Buzz  | fizz | 
| fiz  |  buzz | buzz   |
