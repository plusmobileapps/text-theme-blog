One day at my day job, I noticed that there were a couple of services we used that anytime an event happened there was a very manual process for the developer to copy paste data into a Slack channel for others to be aware of the issue. I thought there had to be a better way to automate this whole process and prevent a developer from having to do this tedious task. That was when I came up with the idea of creating a Slackbot application to do this. So in this article I will describe the process I went through to create a Slackbot using Ktor and webhooks that can post messages to your Slack channel of choice and how to deploy to Heroku. For this example, we will be using [Github webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks) to supply data to our Slackbot but the same principal applies to your service of choice that offers webhooks. 

## Setup 

### Initialize Project

1. First download [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?&code=IIC) and install for your development platform. 
2. Once installed, click configure -> plugins. Then search and install the Ktor plugin. 

![](/assets/images/intellij-extension.png)

3. Create a new project and select Ktor in the side bar. For the sake of this tutorial, we are going to use the GSON library for JSON serialization. But this is swappable with other JSON serializers of your choosing. 

![](/assets/images/create-ktor-project.png)

After giving your project a name and finishing the setup, you should be able to run the project with the following command and open up your browser to [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080). 

```bash
gradle run
```

### Create a Slack Bot App 

Go to [Slack's API website](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app. Give a name for your bot and the workspace that this bot will have access to. 

![](/assets/images/slack-app-create.png)

Under OAuth and Permissions, we need to give our bot the permission to write to our Slack channels so go ahead and add the following permission. 

![](/assets/images/slack-bot-permissions.png)

At the top of this page, you should now be able to install this bot to your workspace. 

![](/assets/images/install-slack-bot.png)

Now that you have installed the bot to the workspace, it should land you back on OAuth and Permissions page with a token that we will use later to authenticate with our Slack instance to post messages. This key should be kept private and not checked into any repository which we will discuss in a bit how to keep this secret. 

![](/assets/images/slack-bot-token.png)

### Add Java Slack SDK

Now we will add the [Java Slack SDK](https://github.com/slackapi/java-slack-sdk) to our project. First open up the `build.gradle` file, and add the following three lines to the dependencies block. 

```groovy
    implementation "com.slack.api:slack-api-client:$slack_version"
    // Add these dependencies if you want to use the Kotlin DSL for building rich messages
    implementation "com.slack.api:slack-api-model-kotlin-extension:$slack_version"
    implementation "com.slack.api:slack-api-client-kotlin-extension:$slack_version"
```

Then in `gradle.properties` we can create the variable for the version. 

```groovy
slack_version=1.2.1
```

Now sync gradle and the Slack Java SDK should be accessible. If you have any trouble setting this up, the official instructions from Slack can be found [here](https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/web-api-client-setup).

## Posting Messages 

Before we can post any messages, lets now add the Slack bot token to our project as an environment variable since you should never be checking in api tokens directly to your repository. Click on the gradle configuration in the top toolbar, and edit configurations. Then click on the right icon of environment variables and click the plus button to add an environment variable. 

![](/assets/images/slack-token-env-variable.png)

Our bot doesn't have permissions to join channels, so to prevent the `not_in_channel` error add the bot by @ it in the slack channel you want to post a message to. `@Plus Mobile Apps Slack Bot` in the `#general` channel. 

To create a simple message, lets create a new file called `HomeRoute`. Here we will create an extension function on `Route` which will post a simple message anytime the home page is retrieved. 

```kotlin
fun Routing.homeRoute() {
    get("/") {
        val token = System.getenv("SLACK_TOKEN")
        val slack = Slack.getInstance()
        val response = slack.methods(token).chatPostMessage {
            it.channel("#general")
                .text("Hello :wave:")
        }
        call.respondText("Response is: $response")
    }
}
```

Don't forget to add this function to your routes on the `Application.kt` file. 

```kotlin
fun Application.module(testing: Boolean = false) {
    routing {
        homeRoute()
    }
}
```

Now run the gradle configuration in IntelliJ and go `http://0.0.0.0:8080`. This route should now trigger a message being sent to the general channel.

## Deploy to Heroku

If you don't have a Heroku account yet, go to the [website](https://www.heroku.com) and create one. Once signed in, create a new app in the top right and give it a name of your choice. Then you will need to [install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) in order to push your code. Now login to your Heroku account through the CLI and add the Heroku git remote. (This name should be under the deploy tab on Heroku if you forget the name of of your app.)

```bash
heroku login
heroku git:remote -a ktor-slack-bot
```

Now go into the settings of your Heroku app and we will add the Slack token from earlier. 

![](/assets/images/heroku-env-variable.png)

Heroku itself is not always going to run on port 8080 and actually passes this port number as an environment variable, so the application needs to be tweaked to take a `PORT` variable. 

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val port = System.getenv("PORT").toIntOrNull() ?: 8080
    embeddedServer(Netty, port) {
        routing {
            homeRoute()
        }
    }.start(wait = true)
}
```

Now in the `build.gradle` file, the entry point to the app needs to be updated with the `mainClassName`. We are also going to add two more tasks while we are here called `jar` and `stage`. Jar will package the app into an executable file and stage is needed by Heroku which is run when deploying your app. 

```groovy
mainClassName = "com.plusmobileapps.ApplicationKt"

jar {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class' : "com.plusmobileapps.ApplicationKt"
    }
    from { configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) } }
}

task stage {
    dependsOn jar
}
```

Next, there is a special file we will make in the root of our project called [`Procfile`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile), this is what tells Heroku how to run our app once it is deployed. Add the following to this file which will run the jar file that is generated from the stage task. 

```
web: java -jar ./build/libs/slackbot-0.0.1.jar
```

To [run Heroku locally](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local), create a `.env` file in the root of the project folder where we will specify the `SLACK_TOKEN` and `PORT` variables. Don't forget to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to avoid checking in your secrets to your version control.  

```
SLACK_TOKEN=your-token-here
PORT=8080
```

Then run the stage task and Heroku local command. 

```bash
gradle stage
heroku local
```

After validating everything is working locally, now you can finally deploy your Slackbot to Heroku by pushing it to the Heroku remote which will kick off the stage task. The url where your app is deployed will be printed in the console at the end of the deployment. So for this app, if you type `https://ktor-slack-bot.herokuapp.com/` into your browser you will kick off the simple message to the #general channel from the Slackbot. 

```bash
git push heroku master

All of the changes needed to deploy can be found in this [commit](https://github.com/plusmobileapps/kotlin-slackbot/commit/d0f1c6f0bf20ac267409f7fac98eec032080bef4). 

## Listen for web hooks to post messages

The application until this point is pretty simple, but now that the application is deployed there is a URL you can use to register for web hooks. For this example, we will use Github web hooks from this repository which you can register in the settings section of the repository -> web hooks.

![](/assets/images/slackbot-add-webhook.png)

To test what data this endpoint will be receiving, I use a service called [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com) which will set up an endpoint of your choice and will display the JSON that is sent from the webhook. After creating an endpoint on Beeceptor, register the url from Beeceptor as a webhook for the repository in order to see what JSON is sent in the payload. When you are first setting up a Github webhook, there are two requests that will be sent. 

1. [Ping](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#ping) - sent when the webhook is first setup correctly
2. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#push) - sent whenever a commit is pushed to the repository

Both of these JSON payloads are saved into the [json/](https://github.com/plusmobileapps/kotlin-slackbot/tree/master/json) folder of the repository. 

Now create a new route in the application that will receive the webhook event, deserialize the JSON, and then post a message to Slack with the information we want. [`GithubPushEvent`](https://github.com/plusmobileapps/kotlin-slackbot/blob/3f08c002b58c99ab37f1613eb79d7b20440ab213/src/GithubPushEvent.kt) is just the JSON from the payload represented as a Kotlin class. Do not forget to add this extension function to your `Application#route` block. 

```kotlin
fun Route.githubWebhookRoute() {
     post("kotlin-slackbot-github") {
         val request = call.receive<GithubPushEvent>()

         val token = System.getenv("SLACK_TOKEN")
         val slack = Slack.getInstance()
         val response = slack.methods(token).chatPostMessage {
             it.channel("#general")
                 .text("""
                     New commit pushed to `${request.repository.full_name}` by ${request.pusher.name}
                     > ${request.head_commit.message}
                     ${request.head_commit.url}
                 """.trimIndent())
         }
         call.respondText("Response is: $response")
     }
 }
```

To test locally, run the application and use your tool of choice to send a post request. I use Postman and send the post request to the application's local host with the JSON payload saved earlier from the push event.

After everything is working locally, go ahead and deploy to Heroku. The end result of the message posted to Slack whenever a commit is pushed to the repository!

## Prevent blocking thread

Before we are done, if you look closely at the posting of the message there is a warning from the IDE that there is an inappropriate blocking method call. Since Ktor uses coroutines, the easiest solution to fix this is to simply move this call off of the original thread using `withContext()` and indicating which Dispatcher this should be run on.  

![](/assets/images/blocking-thread.png)

```kotlin
fun Route.githubWebhookRoute() {
    post("kotlin-slackbot-github") {
        ...
        val responses = mutableListOf<Any>()

        withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
            val response = slack.methods(token).chatPostMessage {
                it.channel("#kotlin-slackbot")
                    .text(
                        """
                    New commit pushed to `${request.repository.full_name}` by ${request.pusher.name}
                    > ${request.head_commit.message}
                    ${request.head_commit.url}
                """.trimIndent()
                    )
            }
            responses.add(response)
        }

        call.respondText("Response is: $responses")
    }
}
```

Now the warning is gone and the application will no longer be blocking the main thread when the endpoint is hit. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have created a Slack application using Kotlin, Ktor, and Heroku that can listen to webhook events and post messages to our Slack. Everything done here can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/plusmobileapps/kotlin-slackbot). We just scratched the tip of the iceberg in this article, but the Slack API is very powerful and encourage you to explore all of the different [methods](https://api.slack.com/methods) you can use to create a powerful Slackbot. Happy coding!
