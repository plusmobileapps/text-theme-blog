A list of all the different programs, packages, and tips for how I configure my Mac for development.

## Installed From Terminal

[Home Brew](https://brew.sh/) - helps you install packages from the command line more easily similar to linux's package manager

[Git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03#file-mac-md) - version control system

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - terminal replacement

[Oh My ZShell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) - customize the terminal

* I use the `agnoster` theme. To change open up `~/.zshrc` file and change the following line 

```bash
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

* If the theme is not rendering properly in iTerm, then install [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). Copy/paste the following to install. Then in iTerm preferences, check the option to `Use a differnt font for non-ASCII text` and switch the font to `Mesio LG L for powerline`. [Screen shot](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/1906#issuecomment-252443982)

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
# install
cd fonts
./install.sh
# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts
```

* [Oh My ZShell Plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins) that I use - `plugins=(git adb vscode)`
    * [adb](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/adb) - Android Debug Bridge autocomplete plugin
    * [git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) - aliases and autocomplete for git
    * [vscode](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/vscode) - aliases and autocomplete for visual studio code editor




## Downloadable Applications

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - text editor and markdown editor

* to open files from the command line follow these [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
* `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"` - to configure git as the default editor

[Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - version control GUI for Git repositories

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - window control management tool for Mac

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - IDE for developing Android applications

[IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - IDE that Android Studio was based off and I use for developing any Kotlin Multiplatform apps

[Drop to GIF](https://github.com/mortenjust/droptogif) - easy tool to convert videos to GIFs that I use for adding GIFs to pull requests

[Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/) - mac app that makes it dead simple to start up a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) server


## Bash Profile

Since I use [Oh My ZShell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), my bash profile is sourced from `.zshrc` file in my home directory as opposed to `.bash_profile`. My bash profile consists of a bunch of git aliases and helper functions for dealing with the Android SDK. For some Android specific bash profile functions & aliases, check out [Android Bash Profile and Terminal Tricks](https://plusmobileapps.com/2019/03/05/android-terminal-tricks.html)

```bash
alias edit_profile='code ~/.zshrc'
alias source_profile='source ~/.zshrc'

# when ran from the root of a git repo, will take an argument for the branch name
# will then check if your current work station is clean, if not you can type "stash" to stash them
# or will do nothing and not checkout the branch
# After finished reviewing code, hit enter and it will remove the code reviewed branch from your local machine 
# and checkout your existing branch
code_review() {
  branch=$(git branch | sed -n -e 's/^\* \(.*\)/\1/p')
  git diff-index --quiet HEAD
  if [ $? = 1 ]; then
    echo "Branch: $branch is dirty, if you would like to stash your changes type stash"
    read input
  if [ "$input" = "stash" ]; then
    git stash
    git fetch
    git checkout $1
    echo "Hit enter when you are done reviewing this branch"
    read userInput
    git reset --hard
    git checkout $branch
    git branch -d $1
    git stash pop
  else
    echo "Cool, nothing happened"
  fi;
  else
    git fetch
    git checkout $1
    echo "Hit enter when you are done reviewing this branch"
    read userInput
    git reset --hard
    git checkout $branch
    git branch -d $1
  fi
}
```


## Change Location of Where Screenshots Get Saved

Open up a terminal and enter the following two commands.

```bash
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location <folder location>
killall SystemUIServer
```

For me, I typically save any screenshots in `~/Pictures/screenshots`.

Then if you would like even quicker access to your screenshots, I will click and drag that folder to the bottom right section of dock next to Downloads. 

Then whenever you take a screen shot, you will see it show up in your bottom toolbar. 

Just a reminder to take a screen shot of the whole screen, you can use the following command. 

![full screen capture](/assets/images/screen-cap-whole-screen.png)

Then to take a screen shot of just a portion of the screen you can use: 

![portion of the screen capture](/assets/images/screen-cap-part-screen.png)
